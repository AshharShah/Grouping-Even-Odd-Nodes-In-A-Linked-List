# Grouping-Even-Odd-Nodes-In-A-Linked-List 
 This is a project i got in my 3rd semester in the university in my Data Structures and Algorithms Course.
 
 ðŸ”µ How it works:
 1) You may enter values into a linked list.
 2) The Program then arranges the linked list on the bases of even and odd nodes (indexes not values) such that, all even indexs are grouped together after which a group of odd indexes follow in respective order.

ðŸ”¹Before Sorting: 5(1)->7(2)->3(3)->6(4)->11(5)->0(6) ~ value(index)

ðŸ”¹After Sorting: 7(2)->6(4)->0(6)->5(1)->3(3)->11(5)
